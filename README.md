Key Features
Company and Address Relationship: The project models a company entity with a one-to-one relationship with its address. This ensures a clean and efficient representation of the company's location.

Company and Computer Relationships: There are two relationships between the company and computer entities - a one-to-many relationship and a many-to-one relationship. This showcases the flexibility of Hibernate in handling different types of associations.

CRUD Operations: The project includes robust CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for both the company and computer entities. This demonstrates the full spectrum of data management capabilities provided by Hibernate.
